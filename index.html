          <h3>üöÄ Bridging Business, Data & Innovation | MSIS at SCU</h3>
          <p>
            I am a Master‚Äôs student in Information Systems at Santa Clara
            University with a background in Entrepreneurship and Innovation from
            Menlo College. Passionate about data, strategy, and technology, I
            thrive at the intersection of business and tech‚Äîleveraging AI,
            analytics, and system design to drive meaningful impact. Currently,
            I‚Äôm working with Grammarly on an Enterprise Growth Segmentation
            project and advising startups through SCU‚Äôs BEACH Program, helping
            bridge business and technology. As VP of Mentorship for WIB, I
            create mentorship and networking opportunities to empower women in
            business and tech.

          <h3>üåç A Global Perspective & A Bold Journey</h3>
          <p>
            Originally from Guadeloupe, a French overseas region in the
            Caribbean, I leaped at 15 to study in the U.S., driven by a thirst
            for knowledge and new experiences. My time at Silver Creek High
            School in Colorado opened my world, leading me back to the U.S. to
            pursue my passion for business, technology, and problem-solving.

        <div class="about-subsection">
          <h3>üí° Passion for Data, Web3 & Strategic Thinking</h3>
          <p>
            I co-founded the Blockchain Club Initiative at Menlo College and now
            focus on data science and AI with projects in NLP, clustering, and
            sentiment analysis. My latest work explores Spotify data, happiness
            trends, and customer insights through machine learning.

          <h3>üé® Creativity & Technology: A Unique Blend</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond data, creativity is at my core. I‚Äôve been creating
            Zentangle-inspired art since 2016 and found a love for coding
            through SheCodes‚Äîblending art, data, and technology in ways that
            fuel my curiosity.
