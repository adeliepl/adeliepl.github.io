            <h3>üöÄ Bridging Business, Data & Innovation | MSIS at SCU</h3>
            <p>
              I am a Master‚Äôs student in Information Systems at Santa Clara University, passionate about data, strategy, and technology. With a background in Entrepreneurship and Innovation from Menlo College, I thrive at the intersection of business and tech, using data-driven insights to solve complex problems and drive meaningful impact. As VP of Mentorship for the Women in Business (WIB) club, I actively work to create mentorship and networking opportunities, fostering connections that empower women in business and technology.

            <h3>üåç A Global Perspective & A Bold Journey</h3>
            <p>
              Originally from Guadeloupe, a French overseas region in the Caribbean, I leaped at 15 to study in the U.S., driven by a thirst for knowledge and new experiences. My time at Silver Creek High School in Colorado opened my world, leading me back to the U.S. to pursue my passion for business, technology, and problem-solving.

            <h3>üí° Passion for Data, Web3 & Strategic Thinking</h3>
            <p>
              During my time at Menlo College, I co-founded the Blockchain Club Initiative, diving into the transformative power of blockchain and Web3. Today, I focus on data analytics, AI, and system design, exploring how data can drive better decision-making, innovation, and business growth.

            <h3>üé® Creativity & Technology: A Unique Blend</h3>
            <p>
              Beyond analytics and business, I am an artist at heart. Since 2016, I‚Äôve been creating Zentangle-inspired art, combining intricate patterns into abstract masterpieces. I discovered a love for coding during the pandemic through the SheCodes workshop, and ever since, I‚Äôve enjoyed building, experimenting, and exploring the creative side of technology.
